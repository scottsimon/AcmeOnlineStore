  "fullDescription": "Just when you thought your MacBook Pro was state of the art, Apple introduces the MF839LL/A 13-inch MacBook Pro with new advanced processing power and graphics. New connectivity capabilities potentially speed large file transfers beyond any current connection. All MacBook Pro models are state-of-the-art. This new one takes it out to another edge. New Thunderbolt technology lets you connect high-performance peripherals and high-resolution displays to one port - with data transfer rates up to 10 Gbps. Thunderbolt is based on two fundamental technologies: PCI Express and DisplayPort. And because Thunderbolt is based on DisplayPort technology, the video standard for high-resolution displays, any Mini DisplayPort display plugs right into the Thunderbolt port. To connect a DisplayPort, DVI, HDMI, or VGA display, just use an existing optional adapter. Take everything from games to CAD to HD video projects anywhere. Time makes full-screen HD video calls that are astonishingly crisp. And thanks to the new widescreen format, you can get your friends in the picture, too. And with Mac OS X El Capitan and the latest iLife, you're sure to get a great Mac notebook - all in a precision aluminum unibody enclosure that's less than an inch thin.",
